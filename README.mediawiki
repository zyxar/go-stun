= STUN Implementation in Go =

== Description ==

This repository contains a simple implementation of the STUN protocol, as describes by RFCs 3489 and 5389.

Please note that the implementation is not complete. Among the implementation's limitations, we can point :
* The implementation covers the client's side of the protocol : that is, the discovery process.
* The implementation does not cover the shared secret feature.

However, it can be used with many public servers for basic operations. If you need to determine the kind of NAT you are sitting behind, you can use this implementation with many public servers.

The implementation has been tested with the servers listed in the following document :

http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/STUN

Furthermore, I could not test the implementation with all kind of NATs, since I don't have access to all kinds of NATs.

Please let me know if you find a bug in the discovery process, for a particular kind of NAT.
